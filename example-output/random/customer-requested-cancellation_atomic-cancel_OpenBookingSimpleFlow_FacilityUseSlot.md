# customer-requested-cancellation >> atomic-cancel (OpenBookingSimpleFlow >> FacilityUseSlot)

**Booking Flow:** OpenBookingSimpleFlow

**Opportunity Type:** FacilityUseSlot

**Feature:** Cancellation / Customer Requested Cancellation (Implemented) 

**Test:**  Successful booking and successful cancellation after atomic failed cancellation request

After a successful booking, and an unsuccessful but atomic cancellation request, successfully cancel, including checking the Orders feed. Atomic means that the cancellation request either entirely succeeds (all OrderItems items are cancelled) or entirely fails (no OrderItems are cancelled), which is generally best achieved by wrapping code in a database transaction.

### Running only this test

```bash
npm start -- --runInBand test/features/cancellation/customer-requested-cancellation/implemented/atomic-cancel-test.js
```
