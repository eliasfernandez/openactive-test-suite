# anonymous-leasing >> lease-opportunity-multiple-capacity-update (OpenBookingSimpleFlow >> FacilityUseSlot)

**Booking Flow:** OpenBookingSimpleFlow

**Opportunity Type:** FacilityUseSlot

**Feature:** Leasing / Anonymous leasing, including leaseExpires (Implemented) 

**Test:**  Multiple anonymous leased spaces are unavailable for purchase by other users

For an opportunity with 2 spaces: Check the opportunity has 2 spaces in the feed. Run C1 to book one item (creating an anonymous lease). Check the opportunity has 1 space in the feed. Run C1 again for a new Order UUID for the same opportunity attempting to book 3 spaces, expecting OrderItems to be returned with 1 having no errors, 1 having an OpportunityCapacityIsReservedByLeaseError, and 1 having an OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError.

### Running only this test

```bash
npm start -- --runInBand test/features/leasing/anonymous-leasing/implemented/lease-opportunity-multiple-capacity-update-test.js
```
